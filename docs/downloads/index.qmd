One of the strong assets of the Martini force field is it's easy availability. Here we provide parameter files, example run parameters and example topology files in [Gromacs](http://www.gromacs.org/) format. Note that Martini has also be implemented in [other MD software packages](http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/namd/2.8/ug/node26.html).

In addition we provide specific run parameters, starting structures and topology files from (published) example applications. And last but not least there is a collections of scripts and programs that over the years have been developed in our group and simplify the setup and/or analysis of Martini systems.
