### Artificial light harvesting dye (C8S3) for Martini 3
<hr>

The parameters are for an artificial light harvesting dye (C8S3) which self-assembles into hollow nanotubes. Included are a gro and an itp for C8S3, a unit cell of the brickwork and herringbone formation, the script to make the cylinders, one nanotube and a bundle.
