In this version of Martini 2, water beads were completely removed from our simulation boxes. Interactions between beads are adapted by slightly tweaking the interaction levels and tuning some bonded parameter to reproduce the properties observed with the standard Martini 2 force field. The new force field developed has been shown to nicely reproduce bilayer properties for a large variety of lipids.

**Dry Martini** is so far available only for lipids. A couple of small membrane proteins have been shown to perform equivalently compared to the regular Martini 2 model. Pleaase file the parameter files below and run your first Martini simulations without aqueous solvent! For further background reading on **Dry Martini**, see:
