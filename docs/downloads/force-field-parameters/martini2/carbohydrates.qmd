### Beta-cyclodextrin, Dimethyl-cyclodextrin and Hydroxypropyl-cyclodextrin

The user needs to incorporate a new bead type in the case of beta cyclodextrin which is included in the `martini_v2.1_pc.itp` included in the package. Beta cyclodextrin is represented as a dimer, since it is the most populated type in solution. However it can be easily transformed into a monomer if necessary.
