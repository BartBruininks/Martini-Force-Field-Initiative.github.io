### martinize

Martinize is a python script to generate Martini protein topology and structure files based on an atomistic structure file. It replaces the old [seq2itp](#seq2itp), [atom2cg](#atom2cg) and [ElNeDyn](#elnedyn) scripts. The produced topology and structure files are in a format suitable for Gromacs.

The current version (2.x) has been used rather extensively, however it might still contain errors or bugs. Any feedback is more than welcome! The script is "concatenated": all the different classes, modules and forcefields are in one file. If you want to make changes yourself or add a forcefield we have a modular version available. If you would like to use this, send us an e-mail.

### Cross sectional area calculation

<hr>

#### [ **Usage** ]{style="color:blue"}

We propose here [a gromacs tool](https://cgmartini-library.s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/1_Downloads/tools/other_tools/cross-sectional-area.tar) that can be used to calculate the cross sectional area of membrane protein (or similar inclusion) in membrane. Schematically illustrated in the next figure:

![](cross_sectional_area.jpg)

For more details, see paper (please cite it if you use this code):

[Ollila et al. Protein Shape Change Has a Major Effect on the Gating Energy of a Mechanosensitive Channel Biophys. J, 1651-1659, 2011](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006349511002451)

Compile it as any tool done with gromacs template. Then just run it normally:

`g_density3Darea -f traj.trr -s topol.tpr`

Two groups are required in this calculation (2 is the answer to the "*How many groups?*" question): the first one involves all non-protein beads, the second the protein beads. With `-sl` you can change the 3D density grid size. You need to have the `electrons.dat` in your directory even thought it is not used (this is stupid and should be fixed!).

The area profile is obtained in `area.xvg` (three columns have the same number for historical reasons, this should be fixed as well). It can be visualized in 3D by opening the `proteinformDENS.dat` with `rasmol`, choosing Colors \> Temperature and Slab mode.

If you want to calculate the mechanical energy change of a bilayer due to the inclusion, as done in the publication, you need to calculate the pressure profile outside inclusion. This can be done by using script similar to this:

``` bash
paste proteinformDENS.dat 3Dpp.dat | awk '{if($10>0){pp[$13]+= $14+$18)/2; 
sum[$13]++;}}END{for(i=0;i0){print i" "pp[i]/sum[i]} else{print i" 0"}}}' > test.dat
```

The line above calculates the average lateral pressure profile outside the protein (this idea should be described in the publication).

`proteinformDENS.dat` and `3Dpp.dat` (3D pressure field, ascii format) should be the output from `g_density3Darea`. Grid spacing must be exactly the same.

For more information contact Samuli Ollila ([oollila\@cc.hut.fi](mailto:%20oollila@cc.hut.fi)).

#### [ **Remark** ]{style="color:blue"}

The code **DOES NOT** remove rotation or translation and the protein should be whole inside the box in all frames. This can be done by the following way (to be adapted to each system of course):

``` bash
trjconv -pbc nojump
trjconv -fit transxy
trjconv -pbc mol
trjconv -fit rotxy+transxy
```

<hr>

### Morphological Image Analysis

<hr>

**Morphological Image Analysis Tool**

When analyzing computer simulations of mixtures of lipids and water, the questions to be answered are often of a morphological nature. They can deal with global properties, like the kind of phase that is adopted or the presence or absence of certain key features like a pore or stalk, or with local properties, like the local curvature present at a particular part of the lipid/water interface. While in principle all of the information relating to the global and local morphological properties of a system can be obtained from the set of atomic coordinates generated by a computer simulation, the extraction of this information is a tedious task that usually involves using a visualization program and performing the analysis by eye. Here we present a tool that employs the technique of morphological image analysis (MIA) to automatically extract the global morphology—as given by Minkowski functionals—from a set of atomic coordinates, and creates an image of the system onto which the local curvatures are mapped as a color code. The implementation is intended for the analysis of mixtures of lipids and water obtained from molecular dynamics simulations, but is also in principle applicable to all kinds of coordinates that describe binary mixtures, and is independent of the model and the method used to generate the coordinates.

Details of the method are published in:

### 3D pressure field

<hr>

A customised version of Gromacs for the calculation of local pressure fields is available [here](http://www.lacan.upc.edu/LocalStressFromMD). It is not meant for actual simulation, but rather for post-simulation trajectory analysis using the -rerun option of mdrun. Currently, it is not parallelised so you have to run it on only one CPU.

If you use the code, please cite:

-   Ollila et al. (2009) 3D Pressure Field in Lipid Membranes and Membrane-Protein Complexes. Phys. Rev. Lett. 102: 078101 \[DOI: [10.1103/PhysRevLett.102.078101](http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.102.078101)\]

Here are some useful tools for the analysis of the resulting local pressure field grid:

If you have further question, you can contact either Samuli Ollila ([oollila\@cc.hut.fi](mailto:%20oollila@cc.hut.fi)) or Martti Louhivuori.

<hr>

### Mean-field boundaries

<hr>

Implicit, mean-field force approximation (MFFA) boundary potentials offer a computationally efficient method to simulate e.g. large vesicular systems in spherical liquid droplets. For further information about the method see

-   Risselada et al. (2008) Application of mean field boundary potentials in simulations of lipid vesicles. J Phys Chem B 112:7438-7447

In order to use the method you need [Gromacs/MFFA](https://cgmartini-library.s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/1_Downloads/tools/other_tools/mffa-4.0.5.tar), which is a custom version of Gromacs that supports MFFA potentials. Simple [instructions](mffa_instructions.html) and an [example](https://cgmartini-library.s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/1_Downloads/tools/other_tools/mffa-example.tar) system also available.

### ElNeDyn {#elnedyn}

**ElNeDyn** stands for **El**astic **Ne**twork in **Dyn**amics. In this approach an elastic network (EN; a set of springs or harmonic bonds between interacting sites) is used as a structural scaffold to describe and control the overall shape of a molecule. The EN is then combined with a coarse-grained molecular force field to describe the intra- and inter-molecular interactions.

![](ElNeDyn.jpeg)

The current version of *ElNeDyn* focusses on modeling proteins and has been developed in conjunction with the Martini CG force field (2.0, 2.1) but can in principle be mixed with any CG model for any type of molecule. The Martini FF presents the great advantage to include a large body of biomolecules and solvents making simulations of biomolecular systems actually possible.

The rationale for the use of EN is to control the conformation of the protein while keeping its internal dynamics. This has been possible by parametrizing the EN against atomistic model simulations. By tuning the force constant of the springs and the extend of the network, backbone deformations, fluctuations and large amplitude domain motions observed in atomistic simulations of proteins have been matched. For more detail refer to X. Periole et al. 2009 JCTC 5:2531-43.

One notable detail is that the description of the bonded terms defined in original Martini for proteins has been slightly modified to accommodate for the placement of the backbone bead on the Calpha instead on the center-of-mass of the backbone atoms. The non-bonded terms were used as in the original force field.

In the following you'll find a tar.gz file containing the scripts and programs (listed below) that will allow you to build the topology of protein from a pdb file.

**Download:** [ElNeDyn-2.1.tar.gz](https://cgmartini-library.s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/1_Downloads/tools/proteins_and_bilayers/ElNeDyn-2.1.tar)

Files and short description: - AA.dat : contains the definition of the amino acids. - cg-2.1.dat : contains the definition of the bonded terms. - cg-2.1.dat.comments : description of the content of cg-2.1.dat. - pdb2CGpdb-2.1.f : fortran code reading a pdb file of a protein and giving a CG version of it. - topol-CG-2.1.f : fortran code reading the CG coordinates and building the ElNeDyn topology. - HowTo-ElNeDyn.pdf : a step-by-step description of the procedure to get from the pdb file to an MD run. - a set of mdp files to minimize, relax and simulate your ElNeDyn model.

For more information contact Xavier Periole ([x.periole\@rug.nl](mailto:%20x.periole@rug.nl)).

The development of *ElNeDyn* is done in close collaboration with Prof. [M. A. Ceruso](http://www.sci.ccny.cuny.edu/~mceruso/) at the CCNY-CUNY in New York City, USA.

### molmaker.py: Create molecule coordinates from their .itps

-   [molmaker.py](https://cgmartini-library.s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/1_Downloads/tools/proteins_and_bilayers/molmaker.py)

This tool creates a .gro from an .itp file. It works by randomly scattering coordinates along a linear stretch and then performing an evil minimization as VdW and charges are faded in (using the free energy code). As you already guess, it's totally useless for proteins unless you want a linear segment (in which case it works pretty well!).

Additionally, molmaker.py will likely not preserve your chiral centers unless you protect them in your topology using some sort of dihedral potential/restraint. Alternatively you might want to hand-correct each center using other tools and then energy-minimizing.

Check the -h flag for more details. Please report bugs in the [GitHub project](https://github.com/mnmelo/molmaker).

### Nanodisc builder

Nanodisc technology is increasingly being applied for structural and biophysical studies of membrane proteins. Here you can find a general protocol for constructing nanodiscs for molecular dynamics simulations. The protocol is written in python and based on geometric equations, making it fast and easy to modify, enabling automation and customization of nanodiscs in silico. The tool allows one to efficiently construct any membrane scaffold protein (MSP) variant given only an input sequence.

![](nanodisc.gif)

The tool, developed by Lisbeth Kjølbye in the group of Birgit Schiøtt, can be found here: <https://github.com/LHRK/Nanodisc-Builder>

A paper describing the tool and showing examples of its validation is published in JCIM: <https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jcim.1c00157>
