### TS2CG: Triangulated Surfaces to Coarse Grain
<hr>

TS2CG is an algorithm to backmap a triangulated surface to a corresponding coarse-grained model.
 
The software can be downloaded from this [link](https://cgmartini-library.s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/1_Downloads/tools/resolution_transformation/TS2CG-master.zip), or by visiting [https://github.com/marrink-lab/TS2CG](https://github.com/marrink-lab/TS2CG).

### Backward
<hr>

Backward is a tool to convert a coarse-grained system to united-atom or all-atom resolution. The mapping is done using a library of mapping definitions, which encode the geometric reconstruction.

In most cases, the backmapping is performed using the wrapper initram.sh, which calls backward.py and subsequently relaxes the resulting structure through energy minimization and molecular dynamics based relaxation.

When using this method, please cite:

### Resolution transformation

Custom version of Gromacs to reintroduce atomistic details to CG structures [gmx_rev.tar.gz](https://cgmartini-library.s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/1_Downloads/tools/resolution_transformation/gmx_rev.tar).

If you use the code, please cite:

We recommend you use Backward instead of this tool. For details about this tool please contact Andrzej Rzepiela ([Andrzej.Rzepiela@physik.uni-freiburg.de](mailto: Andrzej.Rzepiela@physik.uni-freiburg.de))
