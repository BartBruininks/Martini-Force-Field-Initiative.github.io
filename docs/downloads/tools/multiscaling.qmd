### TS2CG: Triangulated Surfaces to Coarse-Grained

`TS2CG` converts triangulated surfaces (TS) to coarse-grained membrane models for molecular simulation. It also works as a backmapping algorithm from dynamically triangulated surfaces simulations to CG molecular dynamics simulations or to take electron microscopy tomography data and build structures for molecular dynamics simulations.

### Backward

Backward is a tool to convert a coarse-grained system to united-atom or all-atom resolution. The mapping is done using a library of mapping definitions, which encode the geometric reconstruction. The tool consists of three scripts and a number of CG to fine-grained mapping definition files. 

For more details and to download the latest version, visit the [[GitHub repository]](https://github.com/Tsjerk/Backward/tree/master).
