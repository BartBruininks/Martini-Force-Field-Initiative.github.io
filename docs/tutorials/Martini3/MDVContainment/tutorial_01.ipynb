    "## What is Containment\n",
    "Containment can be simply thought of as something *surrounding* something else completely (Fig. 0). This is useful for analyzing volumetric data in a hierarchical manner, allowing for robust processing at high throughput. This means containment it is a property which combines: \n",
    "\n",
    "1) **Components** How the total space is partitioned (Strongly Connected Components analysis, SCC).\n",
    "2) **Contact Graph** Components that share a boundary are connected with an edge.\n",
    "3) **Containment Graph** A component can be contained by another combonent, causing its edge designating the contact to point from the container to the containee. I.e. the contained component lies downstream of the container component in the acyclic directed graph (DAG).  Only the directed edges are present in the containment graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "Identifying inside and outside is non-trivial in periodic spaces and MDVContaiment uses the concept of percolation to solve this problem. A component is considered contained if its inverse has a higher percolation number (rank) than the component itself, where the inverse of a component is all of space which is not the component in question. Meaning it also works for objects spanning the PBC such as a hollow periodic cylinder.\n",
    "\n",
    "The binary nature of the component labeling (all labels are strongly connected) in combination with the containment status of individual components is enough to collapse the contact graph into the containment graph (adding direction and defining what is outside). The [manuscript](https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.08.06.668936) of this work is available as a preprint.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img src=\"containment_examples.png\" width=\"600\"/></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fig. 0** Some examples of contaiment in periodic spaces. **(A)** A vesicle formed from a bicelle. **(B)** A periodic cylinder formed by dye molecules. **(C)** A lipoplex hovering above a membrane. **D** A horrific triple stacked bilayer system in which one of them has a pore. Try to wrap your head around that one with your intution... In all the figures the red and blue densities represent lipid and solvent phases respectively. A density is rendered opaque if it does not have a child (it is a leaf in the containment graph), otherwise it is transparent (is a container). The arrows point from container to content. One can put every content into its container recursively to obtain the full box (albeit fragmented as is the case in system C).  "

    "### Goal & Axioms\n",
    "### Goal\n",
    "To obtain a definition of containment resulting in a containment graph spanning the\n",

    "are the nodes in the graph and the directions of the edges indicate containment.\n",
    "The graph should satisfy the following conditions: First, a node cannot have more\n",
    "than one inward pointing edge. A, node can have more than one outward pointing\n",
    "edge. Second, the alteration of the containment hierarchy downstream should never\n",
    "affect the containment hierarchy upstream. All these conditions are satisfied by the\n",

    "(A of rank 2) is indicated with a preceding subscript number (2A). Since a complement\n",

The resolution should never be smaller than the first neighbor distance of the condensed phase you are studying. For Martini CG systems this is about 0.5 nm, with closing to fill small holes. For atomistic data a smaller resolution could be used, although usually a resolution of 0.5 with or without closing works pretty good. In general a smaller value for the resolution results in an increase in computational load, both for memory and compute."

    "2. Component -1 is contained by component 1 (the arrow points from 1 to -1).\n",
    "3. Components of rank 1 would be volumetric curves (a topological wire) spanning the PBC.\n",

    "5. Yes, a root node can be a leaf node\n",
    "6. If the voxel perfectly tile the box, the voxel grid is translational invariant under interger translations.\n",
    "7. The PBC are taken into account for mesh generation, as no triangles are added at the box 'bounradies'. However, duplicate vertex positions exist for vertices at the boundaries (not properly identified). This can be fixed, but would mess with the area calculations, so be careful.\n",
    "8. By using containment to generate specific meshes, we keep our handles on the resultin meshes, allowing us to identify which densities cause which areas without oppertunistic guessing.\n"
