### Introduction
<hr>

In this tutorial, we will discuss how to build a Martini 3 topology for a new small molecule using a semi-automated method with the FastForward Python package. This tutorial builds on ideas and techniques discussed in the (classic Small Molecule Parameterization tutorial)[../Small_Molecule_Parametrization/index.qmd], and it is recommended that you do that tutorial before this one.


As before, we will use as an example the molecule *1-ethylnaphthalene* (Fig. 1), and make use of `Gromacs` versions 2024.x or later. FILES AVAILABLE HERE


![Figure 1 | 1-ethylnaphthalene.](fig1.png)

### 1. Generate atomistic reference data
<hr>


Here, we will use the [SwissParam server](https://swissparam.ch/) as a way to obtain an atomistic (or all-atom, AA) structure and molecule topology based on the Charmm36 force field, but of course feel free to use your favorite atomistic force field.

> The previous tutorial used [LigParGen](https://zarbi.chem.yale.edu/ligpargen/) to obtain reference topologies. It may be instructive to investigate how the results obtained in parameterization here are different to that one.

Start by feeding the SMILES string for *1-ethylnaphthalene* (namely, `CCc1cccc2ccccc21`) to the SwissParam server. After submitting the molecule, the server will generate input parameters for several molecular dynamics (MD) packages. Download the resulting zip file. You can now unzip the zip archive provided:

``` bash
unzip files-m3-parametrize_new_small_molecule.zip
```

which contains a folder called `ENAP-in-water` that contains some template folders and useful scripts. We will assume that you will be carrying out the tutorial using this folder structure and scripts. Note that the archive contains also a folder called `ENAP-worked` where you will find a worked version of the tutorial (trajectories not included). This might be useful to use as reference to compare your files (e.g., to compare the `ENAP_LigParGen.itp` you obtained with the one you find in `ENAP-worked/1_AA-reference`).

We can now move to the first subfolder, `1_AA-reference`, and copy over the files you just obtained from the LigParGen server:

``` bash
cd ENAP-in-water/1_AA-reference
```
> [move here the obtained zip file from the SwissParam server.]

Input files obtained from `SwissParam` come with a default residue name of `LIG`. For now, this does not particularly matter, but it may be useful to change it for record keeping or future reference.

Now launch the AA MD simulation:

``` bash
bash generate_atomistic_reference.sh
```

The last command will run an energy-minimization, followed by an NPT equilibration of 250 ps, and by an MD run of 10 ns (inspect the script and the various `.mdp` files to know more). Note that 10 ns is a rather short simulation time, selected for speeding up the current tutorial. You should rather use at least 50 ns, or an even longer running time in case of more complex molecules (you can try to experiment with the simulation time yourself!). In this case, the solvent used is water; however, the script can be adapted to run with any other solvent, provided that you input also an equilibrated solvent box. You should choose a solvent that represents the environment where the molecule will spend most of its time. Finally, a solvent-free trajectory is generated to use for mapping purposes later.

### 2. Atom-to-bead mapping
<hr>

Following the rules set out in the (classic Small Molecule Parameterization tutorial)[../Small_Molecule_Parametrization/index.qmd], the molecule can be mapped to 6 T-beads, as shown in Fig. 2 below:

    <figcaption>Figure 2 | Atom-to-bead mapping of the 1-ethylnaphthalene.</figcaption>
    </center>
</figure>


### 3. Generate the CG mapped trajectory from the atomistic simulation
<hr>

Using the mapping you just created, you will now transform the simulation you did at [section 1](#generate-atomistic-reference-data) to CG resolution using a file in the `.map` format.

The [CGbuilder tool](https://jbarnoud.github.io/cgbuilder/) can generate such a file, as it did with the index-based approach in the previous tutorial <sup>[[7]](#references)</sup>. Load the `lig.gro` generated in the previous step, and assign each of the atoms to its corresponding bead in the viewer.

You can now try to map the trajectory using a `.map` file from `CGBuilder`. Once done, download the `cgbuilder.map` file that `CGbuilder` creates to the `2_mapping` folder.

``` bash
cd ../2_mapping/
```
> [download cgbuilder.map and move it to the current folder, i.e., '2_mapping']

The header of `CGbuilder` .map files doesn’t quite align with what we exactly need for `fast_forward`. Make sure the first two lines of the file read as:

``` bash
[ molecule ]
LIG ENAP
```

These lines define the name of the molecule at atomistic (`LIG`) and CG (`ENAP`) resolution.

You can now run the script:

``` bash
bash 2_mapping.sh
```

which will:

 1. Make a python virtual environment and install the fast forward package in it.
 2. Use the `ff_map` program of `fast_forward` to map the ligand-only trajectory generated in the previous step.

Note that running `ff_map` on a trajectory file automatically generates both the mapped trajectory and a single initial frame. Note in the `mapped.gro` file generated the residue name is now `ENAP`, having been defined in the `.map` file above.

### 4. Generating an initial CG topology
<hr>

As before, the first goal of parameterisation is to match the bonded parameters at the CG level to the ones mapped from our atomistic simulation. Using the same bonded network as (before)[../Small_Molecule_Parametrization/index.qmd/], generate an initial topology (i.e. `ENAP_initial.itp`) file for the molecule containing directives for `atoms`, `bonds`, `dihedrals`, `virtual_sitesn`, and `exclusions`.

### 4.1 Using fast_forward to generate initial parameters

One of the powerful features of fast_forward is the `ff_inter` (interactions) program, which can generate best guess parameters for a CG topology file from an initial input topology and a mapped trajectory.

The initial input topology can be readily adapted from the file that we’ve just generated. Two additional considerations are:

 1. All interactions (*bonds*, *angles*, *dihedrals*, etc) need to be annotated with an interaction group name
 2. Bonds may be left as bonds only, `ff_inter` will automatically convert high force constants to constraints.


The first interactions directive of the file can then look something like this:

``` bash
[bonds]
; i j funct length kb
 1 2 1 0.300 5000 ; C1_R1
 1 4 1 0.300 5000 ; C1_R4
 2 3 1 0.300 5000 ; R2_R3
…
[ dihedrals ]
; i j k l func ref.angle force_const
 1 3 6 5 2 0 10 ; C1_R3_R6_R5
…
```
Note as well that the initial guesses here are completely arbitrary. Any interaction will be analysed *ab initio* with new parameters calculated.

To run `ff_inter` we also need a reference `.tpr` file for the molecule on its own:

``` bash
gmx grompp -f initial.mdp -p topol.top -c ../2_mapping/mapped.gro -o mapped.tpr -maxwarn 1
```

The `ff_inter` program can then be invoked with the following command:

``` bash
ff_inter -f ../2_mapping/mapped.xtc -s mapped.tpr -i ENAP_initial.itp -dists -plots -itp-only
```

Here, the mapped trajectory and associated topology (`mapped.xtc` and `mapped.tpr` respectively) are analysed using the interactions notated in the input molecule topology file (`ENAP_initial.itp`). Using the `-dists` flag writes out time series and histogram data for each of the interactions. The histograms are all also plotted in a figure using the `-plots` flag: a file called `distribution_plots.png` is written. For each interaction, the histogram of the interaction data is plotted along with the fit the program has made. Finally, the `-itp-only` flag indicates that strictly *only* the interactions notated in the input file should be determined. Otherwise, `ff_inter` will attempt to generate all possible angles and dihedrals for the molecule from its bonded structure, a feature of the program which may be useful for slightly larger or more flexible molecules.

The program will generate a new itp file based on the molecule name (i.e. `ENAP.itp`). Compare the input and the output file. The output file should now contain both bonds and constraints, with some bonds separated by an `#ifdef` statement for energy minimisation purposes, and written in the constraints directive with the inverse statement. The bond lengths and force constants should now be more ‘optimised’ for an initial simulation, with respect to the distributions calculated and shown in the figure generated.


### 5. Create the CG simulation
<hr>


We can now finalize the first take on the CG model, `ENAP_take1.itp`, where we can use the info contained in the `data_bonds.txt` and `data_dihedrals.txt` files to come up with better guesses for the bonded parameters:

``` bash
cd ../4_CG_sim
```
``` bash
cp ../3_initial_CG/ENAP.itp .
```
``` bash
bash run_CG.sh
```

where the command will run an energy-minimization, followed by an NPT equilibration, and by an MD run of 100 ns (inspect the script and the various `.mdp` files to know more) for the Martini system in water. Finally, a ligand-only trajectory and topology are generated for comparison to the mapped ones made earlier.

### 6. Optimize CG bonded parameters
<hr>

You can now compare the simulated distributions to the reference ones using the final program of the fast_forward package, `ff_assess`. Use the following command:

``` bash
ff_assess -f prod/lig_CG.xtc -s prod/lig_CG.tpr -i ENAP.itp -d ../3_initial_CG/ -plots
```

The `ff_assess` program simply uses the annotated topology of the molecule to calculate the interactions actually obtained during the CG simulation, and plots them against the reference distributions previously generated by `ff_inter` (given in a file path to the `-d` flag). Finally, a score is generated using the [Hellinger distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellinger_distance) comparing the simulated and mapped distributions.

The plot produced should look like this:

<!-- insert figure with html to modify width -->
<figure>
    <center>
    <img src="fig3.png" alt="Figure 3 | CG simulation vs. mapped bonded distributions." style="width:100%">
    <figcaption>Figure 3 | CG simulation vs. mapped bonded distributions.</figcaption>
    </center>
</figure>
The agreement is very good, noted from both the figure above and also the report of the distribution distance scores generated.

Note that the bimodality of the distributions of the first two dihedrals cannot be captured by the CG model. However, the size of the CG distribution will seemingly capture the two AA configurations into the single CG configuration. If the agreement is not satisfactory at the first iteration - which is likely to happen - you should play with the equilibrium value and force constants in the CG `.itp` and iterate till satisfactory agreement is achieved.

### 7. Comparison to experimental results, further refinements, and final considerations
<hr>

#### 7.1 Partitioning free energies
<hr>

Partitioning free energies (see [tutorial on how to compute them](../../Legacy/martini2/free_energy.qmd)) constitute particularly good reference experimental data. In the case of 1-ethyl-naphthalene, a model using 5 TC5 beads for the naphthalene ring, and a TC3 bead for the ethyl group, leads to the following (excellent!) agreement with available partitioning data (the experimental values are from Ref. <sup>[[9]](#references)</sup>):

</table>

#### 7.2 Molecular volume and shape
<hr>

The approach described so far is oriented to high-throughput applications where this procedure could be automated. However, COG-based mappings cannot necessarily always work perfectly. In case packing and/or densities seem off, it is advisable to look into how the molecular volume and shape of the CG model compare to the ones of the underlying AA structure.

To this end, we can use the Gromacs tool `gmx sasa` to compute the solvent accessible surface area (SASA) and the Connolly surface of the AA and CG models. While AA force fields can use the default `vdwradii.dat` provided by Gromacs, for CG molecules, such file needs to be modified. The radii for the Martini R-, S-, and T-beads are 0.264, 0.230, and 0.191 nm, respectively. Take a look at `ENAP-worked/5_SASA/CG/vdwradii_CG.dat` in case of doubts. A small Python script, `make_cg_sasa_file.py` is provided to automate this process.

We also recommend using an updated `vdwradii.dat` for the atomistic reference calculations, instead of the Gromacs default. The file - that you can find among the provided files with the name `vdwradii_AA.dat` - uses more recent vdW radii from [Rowland and Taylor, J. Phys. Chem. 1996, 100, 7384-7391](https://doi.org/10.1021/jp953141+).

Now, run:

``` bash
bash 5_do_sasa.sh
```

that will compute the SASA and Connolly surfaces for both the CG and AA models. The SASA will be compute along the trajectory, with a command that in the case of the AA model looks like this:

``` bash
gmx sasa -f ../../1_AA_reference/prod/lig.xtc -s ../../1_AA_reference/prod/lig.tpr -ndots 4800 -probe 0.191  -o SASA-AA.xvg
```

Note that the probe size is the size of a T-bead (the size of the probe does not matter but you must consistently use a certain size if you want to meaningfully compare the obtained SASA values), and the `-ndots 4800` flag guarantees accurate SASA value. You will instead see that the command used to obtain the Connolly surface uses fewer points (`-ndots 240`) to ease the visualization with softwares such as `VMD`. Indeed, we can now overlap the Connolly surfaces (computed by the script on the energy-minimized AA structure and its mapped version) by using the following command:

``` bash
vmd -m  1_AA_reference/prod/lig.gro  AA/surf-AA.pdb  CG/surf-CG.pdb
```

This should give you some of the views you find rendered below. Below you find also the plot of the distribution of the SASA along the trajectory (Fig. 6) - `distr-SASA-AA.xvg` and `distr-SASA-CG.xvg` -:

![Figure 4 | Comparison of the mapped and target distributions for the SASA in the 1-ethylnaphthalene. AA is in blue, Martini is in red.](fig4.png)

The SASA distributions show a discrepancy of about 5% (the average CG SASA is about 5% smaller than the AA one - see `data_sasa_AA.xvg` and `distr-SASA-CG.xvg`), which is acceptable, but not ideal. Inspecting the Connolly surfaces (AA in blue, CG in red) gives you a clearer picture: while the naphthalene moiety on average seems to be captured quite accurately by the CG model, the T-bead at index 1 does seem not to account for the whole molecular volume of the ethyl group. One way to improve this could be to lengthen bonds 1-2, and 1-4.

#### 7.3 Final considerations
<hr>

This tutorial builds on the  (classic Small Molecule Parameterization tutorial)[../Small_Molecule_Parametrization/index.qmd] to use the FastForward package to provide partial automation of some processes. From here, it may be a good idea to explore some of the other features of the package, particularly the `ff_inter` program, to aid with parameterization of other small molecules from scratch.
