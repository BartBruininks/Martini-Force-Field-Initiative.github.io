### Introduction {#introduction}

<hr>

Accordingly with Martini 3 rules <sup>[\[1\]](#references)</sup>, the Martini Protein model groups 2-4 non-hydrogen atoms together in one coarse-grained bead. Each residue has one backbone bead and 0-5 side-chain beads depending on the side chain of the residue. In contrast to the previous version <sup>[\[2-4\]](#references)</sup>, the secondary structure of the protein influences only the bond/angle/dihedral parameters of each residue. The backbone bead size and type depends solely of the mapping and geometry (linear or branched) of the fragment, with P2 used as default bead chemical type. Residues such as glycine, alanine, valine and proline used different bead types (with only slight differences in polarity and size) given the differences in the mapping, which were chosen to avoid overmapping problems <sup>[\[5\]](#references)</sup>. It is noteworthy that the local secondary structure is predefined by the bonded parameters and thus imposed throughout a simulation. While simple peptides can be easily modeled with this approach, proteins usually need an extra bias to keep a stable tertiary structure, which can be provided by elastic network <sup>[\[6\]](#references)</sup> or Gō-like models <sup>[\[7\]](#references)</sup>. Additional improvements of the protein stability and reliability are achieved by applying the side chain corrections option to add dihedral angles which improve the side chain orientation <sup>[\[8\]](#references)</sup>.

Setting up a coarse-grained protein simulation consists basically of three steps:

1.  converting an atomistic protein structure into a coarse-grained structure;
2.  generating a suitable Martini topology;
3.  solvating the protein in the desired environment.

The first two steps are done using the publicly available program [`martinize2`](https://github.com/marrink-lab/vermouth-martinize). The last step can be done with the tools available in the `GROMACS` package and/or with ad hoc scripts. In this part of the tutorial, basic knowledge of `GROMACS` commands is assumed and not all commands will be given explicitly. Please refer to the previous tutorials and/or the [`GROMACS` manual](https://manual.gromacs.org/2024.2/index.html).

The aim of the first module of this tutorial is to define the regular workflow and protocols to set up a coarse-grained simulation of the soluble globular protein T4-lysozyme. Three strategies are presented and compared: i- no bias; ii- elastic networks; and iii- GōMartini. In a [second module](../../../Martini3/ProteinsII/index.qmd) of this Proteins tutorial we will cover how to insert a transmembrane peptide (KALP) in a lipid bilayer using a standard Martini 3 description.

**The files required for this tutorial (including worked files) can be downloaded from [here](https://cgmartini-library.s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/0_Tutorials/m3_tutorials/ProteinsI/M3_proteins_tutorial_part1.zip).**

### Soluble proteins {#soluble-proteins}

<hr>

The downloaded file is called `M3_proteins_tutorial_part1.zip` and contains a worked version (using `GROMACS` 2020) of this module. You do not need all folders of this file to get going on this tutorial. Only the folder `template` is important. In addition, you can use the worked versions to check your own work. For this part of the tutorial, the worked files are in the `martini3_worked` folder. Create your own directory to work the tutorial yourself. Instructions are given for files you need to download or get from the template folder, etc. You do not need any files to start with. Now go to your own directory.

After getting the atomistic structure of L99A T4 lysozyme (pdb code [181L](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/181L)) <sup>[\[9\]](#references)</sup>, you'll need to convert it into a coarse-grained structure and to prepare a Martini 3 topology for it. Once this is done the coarse-grained structure can be minimized, solvated and simulated. The steps you need to take are the following:

1.  Download **181L.pdb** from the Protein Data Bank. It is also available in the template folder:

``` bash
wget http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/files/181L.pdb
```

2.  The first step before start working with `martinize2` is to clean/fix your atomistic pdb file. You should remove water and other molecules usually used for crystallization. In case there are missing residues or loops you should complete the protein structure using your favorite modeling code (`alphafold2`, `modeller`, etc). Note that cofactors that can be present and might be important for the protein structure and function are not covered by this tutorial. In the case of T4 lysozyme, you only need to remove the waters and a ligand. This can simply be done using the command:

    ``` bash
    grep "^ATOM" 181L.pdb > 181L_clean.pdb
    ```

    The clean pdb structure can be used as input for `martinize2` (installation instructions available [here](https://github.com/marrink-lab/vermouth-martinize)), to generate both a coarse-grained structure and a Martini 3 topology file. Note that `martinize2` might not work with older versions of python! We know it does work with versions \>3.9. Have a look at the help function (i.e. run `martinize2 -h`) for the available options. Hint, valid for any system simulated with Martini: during equilibration it might be useful to have (backbone) position restraints to relax the side chains and their interaction with the solvent; we are anticipating doing this by asking `martinize2` to generate the list of atoms involved. A simple input command to martinize2 might look a bit like this:

    ``` bash
    martinize2 -f 181L_clean.pdb -o t4l_only.top -x t4l_cg.pdb -p backbone -ff martini3001
    ```

    We take the input file `-f`, and specify two output ones, a topology file `-o`, and a coordinate file of the input structure mapped to the martini resolution `-x`. The mapped structure will be to version 3 of the Martini force field via the flag `-ff`.

    To introduce some more structure-based knowledge, we should also specify a secondary structure. Martinize2 has a couple of options for this:

    -   `-dssp` will try to use an installation of [mdtraj](https://www.mdtraj.org/) in the python environment that martinize2 is installed in.

    -   `-dssp /path/to/dssp` will look for a dssp executable in the given path, and use the output from there if it finds it. When using the `-dssp` option you'll need the `dssp` binary, which determines the secondary structure classification of the protein backbone from the structure. It can be downloaded from the <https://github.com/cmbi/dssp/releases>. Note that `martinize2` only works with the `dssp` versions 3.1.4 or earlier, because the output changed in `dssp` version 4. If installed centrally, the path is usually **/usr/bin/dssp**.

    -   `-ss etcetc` will use the `etcetc` dssp formatted string (i.e. a string containing letters used by dssp to indicate different secondary structure elements) that the user provides to specify how the secondary structure is treated, which must contain the same number of characters as the residues you have in the protein. The meaning of the abbreviations is: **H**: α-helix, **B**: residue in isolated β-bridge, **E**: extended strand, participates in β ladder, **G**: 3-helix (3-10 helix), **I**: 5 helix (π-helix), **T**: hydrogen bonded turn, **S**: bend, **C**: loop or irregular. In the case of the T4 lysozyme, the string required for the `-ss` argument is the following:

        ``` bash
        CCHHHHHHHHHCCEEEEEECTTSCEEEETTEEEESSSCHHHHHHHHHHHHTSCCTTBCCHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHCTTTHHHHHHSCHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHTCHHHHHHHHTTCHHHHHHHHHSSHHHHHSHHHHHHHHHHHHHSSSGGGC
        ```

3.  If everything went well, the script generated three files: a coarse-grained structure (`.pdb`; Fig. 1), a master topology file (`.top`), and a protein topology file (`.itp`). In order to run a simulation you need two more files: the Martini topology file (`martini_v3.0.0.itp`) and a run parameter file (`.mdp`). You can get examples from the Martini website or from the `template` folder. Don't forget to adapt the settings where needed!

D) Coarse-grained beads in VdW representation. E) Licorice representation of the backbone of the martinized protein.](fig1.png)

4.  Do a short minimization in vacuum (ca. 10-100 steps is enough!). Before you can generate the input files with `grompp`, you will need to check that the topology file (`.top`) includes the correct Martini parameter file (`.itp`). If this is not the case, change the `include` statement. Also, you may have to generate a box, specifying the dimensions of the system, for example using `gmx editconf`. You want to make sure, the box dimensions are large enough to avoid close contacts between periodic images of the protein, but also to be considerably larger than twice the cut-off distance used in simulations. Try allowing for a minimum distance of 1 nm from the protein to any box edge. Then, copy the example parameter file, and change the relevant settings to do a minimization run. Now you are ready to do the preprocessing and minimization run:

    ``` bash
    gmx editconf -f t4l_cg.pdb -d 1.0 -bt dodecahedron -o t4l_cg.gro
    ```

    ``` bash
    gmx grompp -p t4l_only.top -f minimization.mdp -c t4l_cg.gro -o minimization-vac.tpr  -r t41_cg.gro
    ```

    ``` bash
    gmx mdrun -deffnm minimization-vac -v
    ```

5.  Solvate the system with `gmx solvate` (an equilibrated water box can be downloaded [here](../../../../downloads/example-applications/solvent-systems.qmd#pure-water-solvent); it is called `water.gro`. You can also find the file in the template folder. Make sure the box size is large enough (i.e. there is enough water around the molecule to avoid periodic boundary artifacts) and remember to use a larger van der Waals distance when solvating to avoid clashes, e.g.:

    ``` bash
    gmx solvate -cp minimization-vac.gro -cs water.gro -radius 0.21 -o solvated.gro
    ```

    As the protein is charged **+8**, it is recommended to add at least neutralizing counter ions; on top of that, you can add ions to reflect some ionic strength of the solution. Using a concentration of 0.15 M of NaCl is a popular choice given that is a good representation of the physiologic conditions. NOTE that you'll need to get hold of a Martini topology file that specifies the ion topologies. Be careful in case you use strategies based on `gmx genion`. As each Martini water bead represents 4 water molecules, the concentration specified needs to be adapted to properly represent the target salt concentration.

6.  You need to update the topology to reflect the added water. Here, this is done by copying the topology for the single T4 lysozyme to `system.top` (`cp t4l_only.top system.top`) and editing that to add a line with the number of water beads. The total number of W beads added by `gmx solvate` can be seen in the terminal output of the command; alternatively try `grep -c W system-solvated.gro` (where W is the name of a water bead). You will then do a short energy minimization and position-restrained (NPT) equilibration of the solvated system. Since the `martinize.py` script already generated position restraints (thanks to the `-p` flag), all you have to do is specify `“define = -DPOSRES”` in your parameter file (`.mdp`).

    ``` bash
    gmx grompp -p system.top -c solvated.gro -f minimization.mdp -o minimization.tpr -r solvated.gro
    ```

    ``` bash
    gmx mdrun -deffnm minimization -v
    ```

    ``` bash
    gmx grompp -p system.top -c minimization.gro -f equilibration.mdp -o equilibration.tpr -r solvated.gro
    ```

    ``` bash
    gmx mdrun -deffnm equilibration -v
    ```

7.  Start production run (without position restraints!); if your simulation crashes, some more equilibration steps might be needed. NOTE that you will get a warning about simultaneous use of Parrinello-Rahman barostat and newly generated velocities. This can be ignored by setting the `-maxwarn 1` option.

    ``` bash
    gmx grompp -p system.top -c equilibration.gro -f dynamic.mdp -o dynamic.tpr -maxwarn 1
    ```

    ``` bash
    gmx mdrun -deffnm dynamic -v
    ```

8.  PROFIT! What sort of analysis can be done on this molecule? Start by having a look at the protein with `VMD` (use the script [`cg_bonds-v5.tcl`](../../../../downloads/tools/analysis.qmd#rendering-cg-bonds--constraints-with-vmd) to show the bonds defined in the T4 lysozyme topology. More extensive instructions about viewing Martini simuations can be found in the package [MartiniGlass](https://github.com/Martini-Force-Field-Initiative/MartiniGlass)) or `pymol`. It is often convenient to convert the trajectory so that translation and rotation of the protein is removed. (NOTE, however, that the water is also rotated and this may create some unwanted effects when viewing. It is up to you, really. One thing that does make sense is to make sure that beads that belong to the same molecule, e.g. the protein, are not split across periodic boundary conditions, see the section on elastic network below for explicit instructions how to do this with `gromacs` tools.) Be aware that the `.gro` file given to `VMD` must contain the same (number of) atoms as the `.xtc` file. Therefore, if you choose to write only the protein to the `.xtc` file, also prepare a `.gro` file with only the protein (`minimization-vac.gro` will do).

    ``` bash
    gmx trjconv -f dynamic.xtc -s dynamic.tpr -fit rot+trans -o viz.xtc
    ```

    Select **Protein** first and then **System**. Then, you can open the new `viz.xtc` with `VMD`.

    ``` bash
    vmd equilibration.gro viz.xtc
    ```

    An option to display the bonds without the script `cg_bonds-v5.tcl` is to transform a `.gro` file to a `.pdb` file, and removed the line where is written `ENDMDL` in this `.pdb` file. This option should allow you to visualize the bonds defined by your `itps` in the `tpr` file.

    ``` bash
    gmx trjconv -f  equilibration.gro -s dynamic.tpr  -pbc whole -o equilibration.pdb -conect
    ```

    Select **System** in this step. Then:

    ``` bash
    sed "/ENDMDL/d" -i equilibration.pdb
    ```

    ``` bash
    vmd equilibration.pdb viz.xtc
    ```

    To take a look at your simulation with `pymol`, the trajectory must also be converted to the `.pdb` format. This gives the opportunity to add bond information, which helps in viewing the molecules. Be aware that this file may be very large: you may want to reduce the number of frames. You can also reduce the size by only writing the protein coordinates (but you may want to visualize the solvent or ions as well, so it is up to you).

    ``` bash
    gmx trjconv -f dynamic.xtc -s dynamic.tpr -fit rot+trans -o viz.pdb -conect
    ```

    ``` bash
    pymol viz.pdb
    ```

    Standard analyses for proteins include RMSD, RMSF, and radius of gyration. Refer to tutorials for atomistic models, for example by [Tsjerk Wassenaar](http://md.chem.rug.nl/~mdcourse/) or [Justin Lemkul](http://www.mdtutorials.com/gmx/lysozyme/index.html). For the impatient ones, or if you just need a quick reminder: RMSD and RMSF can be calculated using the `gromacs` tools `gmx rms` and `gmx rmsf`, respectively.

#### Martini + elastic network

<hr>

The aim of this second module is to see how the application of elastic networks can be combined with the Martini model to conserve the tertiary and quaternary structures more faithfully without sacrificing the structure of a protein. Please be advised that this is an active field of research and that there is as of yet no "gold standard".

The idea is to generate a simple elastic network on the basis of a standard Martini 3 topology. The approach can be set up using `martinize2` and will be shortly described below.

We recommend simulating a pure Martini coarse-grained protein (without elastic network) from the previous step, and then seeing which changes are observed when using an elastic network for the same protein. Note that you'll need to simulate the protein for tens to hundreds of nanoseconds to see major changes in the structure; sample simulations are provided in the archive.

The first option to help preserving higher-order structure of proteins is to add to the standard Martini topology extra harmonic bonds between non-bonded beads based on a distance cut-off. Note that in standard Martini, long harmonic bonds can be already used to impose the secondary structure of extended elements (sheets) of the protein. Dihedrals could be used as well, but they tend to bring instabilities in this case – see the paper by **Bulacu et al 2013** <sup>[\[10\]](#references)</sup> for more information. `Martinize2` will generate harmonic bonds between backbone beads if the option `-elastic` is set. It is possible to tune the elastic bonds (e.g.: make the force constant distance dependent, change upper and lower distance cut-off, etc.) in order to make the protein behave properly. The only way to find the proper parameters is to try different options and compare the behavior of your protein to an atomistic simulation or experimental data (NMR, etc.). Be aware that elastic networks are based on your reference atomistic structure.

Here we will use basic parameters in order to show the principle.

1.  Use martinize2 to generate the coarse-grained structure and topology as above. For the elastic network, use the following extra flags:

    ``` bash
    martinize2 -f 181L_clean.pdb -o t4l_only.top -x t4l_cg.pdb -dssp /path/to/dssp -p backbone -ff martini3001 -elastic -ef 700.0 -el 0.5 -eu 0.9 -ea 0 -ep 0
    ```

    This turns on the elastic network (`-elastic`), sets the elastic bond force constant to 700 $kJ*mol^{-1}*nm^{-2}$ (`-ef 700`), the lower and upper elastic bond cut-off to 0.5 and 0.9 nm, respectively (`-el 0.5` and `-eu 0.9`), and makes the bond strengths independent of the bond length (elastic bond decay factor and decay power, `-ea 0` and `-ep 0`, respectively; these are default). Differently from the Martini 2 version, in Martini 3 the elastic network does not need to be defined as a `#ifdef` statement in the `.top` file. Note that `martinize2` does not generate elastic bonds between $i \rightarrow i+1$ and $i \rightarrow i+2$ backbone beads, as those are already connected by bonds and angles (Fig. 2B). Also, elastic bonds are only added between beads that belong to the same chain.

2.  Proceed as before (steps 4 to 7) and start a production run. Keep in mind, we are adding a supplementary level of constraints on the protein; a supplementary relaxation step might be required (equilibration with position restraints and smaller time step for instance). If you have a set-up for the protein without elastic bonds (including solvent and possibly ions), you may use a snapshot from that simulation as the starting point here.

#### Martini + Gō-like model

<hr>

In the third submodule of the protein tutorial, you will learn to apply Gō-like models in combination with the Martini model to conserve the tertiary and quaternary structures more faithfully. A combination of Gō-like models with Martini was presented by **Poma et al. 2017** <sup>[\[7\]](#references)</sup>. Backbone beads are connected based on a contact map and a Lennard-Jones potential describes the interaction between the connected backbone beads. Here, we give an introduction how to set up a protein with Martini 3 and a modified version of the Gō-like models. You can find more details about the new implementation in the [preprint by **Souza et al.**](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.04.15.589479v1).

In brief, the modified version encompasses the following changes compared to the original GōMartini model: First, the Gō-like bonds are applied to virtual sites which are located at the same position as the backbone bead in the Martini protein model. They are implemented as regular non-bonded interactions which allows to treat them with the non-bonded cutoff scheme. Second, the regular non-bonded interaction between two backbone beads which are connected by a Gō-like bond is excluded. Third, a lower and upper limit for the distance between two backbone beads connected with a Gō-like bond is set.

The general work flow is the following: the Gō-like bonds are included as non-bonded interactions in special beads – called Gō beads from hereon – which will be defined in the `martini_v3.0.0.itp`. For this, the `martini_v3.0.0.itp` has to contain two `#include` statements which are only considered if you define the variable `GO_VIRT` in your topology file. This procedure is similar to the `POSRES` variable in a typical Martini protein `.itp` file. Two generic file names are used in the `#include` statements (`go_atomtypes.itp` and `go_nbparams.itp`) which themselves include the specific itps for the actual protein. The coarse-grained (CG) protein structure generated by `martinize2` contains the additional Gō beads; the same holds for the `t4l_only.itp` (which will be the protein `.itp` file generated by `martinize2` in this case). The `t4l_only.itp` contains also the virtual site definition of the Gō beads and an `#include` statement for the exclusions between the (real) backbone beads which are connected by Gō-like bonds.

To generate the GōMartini model of T4 lysozyme, you will have to first obtain a contact map and then generate a Martini 3 protein model using `martinize2`. The procedure is briefly described in the following:

1.  To set up a GōMartini model, the contact map of the atomistic structure must first be obtained from the [web server](http://pomalab.ippt.pan.pl/GoContactMap/) using the default settings. Alternatively, a locally executable version of the contact map generator can be found [elsewhere](https://github.com/Martini-Force-Field-Initiative/GoMartini/tree/main/ContactMapGenerator). Please note that the requirements for the `.pdb` file uploaded to the web-server are quite strict. Thus please check carefully if your contact map is meaningful before using the contact map in the next step. In particular, the table listing the **“Residue residue contacts”** will be used.

2.  Once the contact map has been obtained, the topology files can be generated using martinize2 using the `-go` flag for the contact map.

    ``` bash
    martinize2 -f 181L_clean.pdb -o t4l_only.top -x t4l_cg.pdb -dssp  /path/to/dssp -p backbone -ff martini3001 -go contact_map.out
    ```

    The above command will generate the necessary topology files for performing GōMartini simulations with this protein. As described in the in the [preprint by **Souza et al.**](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.04.15.589479v1), there are also additional options related to the Gō model for adapting non-bonded interactions dependent on secondary structure, which may be used to optimise the dynamics of your protein. These are described further both in the preprint and in the documentation for martinize2 itself.

3.  As mentioned above, the topology for your protein, `t4l_only.itp` now includes extra virtual sites built directly on top of backbone beads, which are used in two further files. Firstly, `go_atomtypes.itp` contains an `[ atomtypes ]` directive defining the virtual sites. Secondly, `go_nbparams.itp` contains a `[ nonbond_params ]` directive defining the Gō bonds between the virtual sites. In order to perform a simulation making use of these extra non-bonded potentials, we have to add the `#include` statements to the `martini_v3.0.0.itp` file. NOTE that you should do this ONLY ONCE.

    ``` bash
    sed -i "s/\[ nonbond_params \]/\#ifdef GO_VIRT\n\#include \"go_atomtypes.itp\"\n\#endif\n\n\[ nonbond_params \]/" martini_v3.0.0.itp
    ```

    ``` bash
    echo -e "\n#ifdef GO_VIRT \n#include \"go_nbparams.itp\"\n#endif" >> martini_v3.0.0.itp
    ```

    If you want to use the Martini 3 force field without any GōMartini model in the future, you just do not define the variable `GO_VIRT` in your topology file and the `#include` statements will be skipped. But for this part of the tutorial it is important to have the line:

    ``` bash
    #define GO_VIRT
    ```

    in the first line of your topology file (I.E. t4l_only.top)! Please check if `martinize2` did take care of this in your master topology file (`-top`). Otherwise, the Gō beads and the Gō-like bonds will not be defined and you will receive an error message from `gmx grompp`.

4.  Proceed as in the first part of the tutorial (steps 4 to 7) and start a production run. Keep in mind, we are adding a supplementary level of constraints on the protein; a supplementary relaxation step might be required (equilibration with position restraints and smaller time step for instance).

![Figure 2 \| Licorice representation of T4 lysozyme backbone in 3 different Martini 3 models: (A) no bias; (B) elastic network (harmonic bonds in red); (C) GōMartini model (pair interactions represented in cyan). It is worth noticing that elastic network not only is different because of the potential function used, but also because the contact map is very different. Illustrations of secondary structure networks can be achieved using the [MartiniGlass](https://github.com/Martini-Force-Field-Initiative/MartiniGlass) tool.](fig2.png)

#### Martini + OLIVES

<hr>

One final model available for Martini proteins is OLIVES, which similar to the Gō model uses non-bonded potentials between beads to retain secondary structure. OLIVES uses a different contact map approach to the standard Gō model described above, based on hydrogen bonding native contacts. Due to a number of features of the OLIVES program (such as multistate functionality), it is not integrated into Martinize2, and must be called via a dedicated routine. Further instructions for OLIVES can be found in the paper by **Pedersen et al. 2017** <sup>[\[11\]](#references)</sup>, and in the examples folder of the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Martini-Force-Field-Initiative/OLIVES).

#### Comparison between models {#comparison-between-models}

<hr>

Now you've got three simulations of the same protein with different Martini protein models. If you do not want to wait, some pre-run trajectories can be found in the archive. One of them might fit your needs in terms of structural and dynamic behavior. If not, there are an almost infinite number of ways to further tweak the elastic network and Gō-like models.

An easy way to compare the slightly different behaviors of the proteins in the previous three cases is to follow deviation/fluctuation of the backbone during simulation (and compare it to an all-atom simulation if possible). RMSD (Fig. 3) and RMSF can be calculated using `gromacs` tools (`gmx rms` and `gmx rmsf`). `VMD` also provides a set of friendly tools to compute these quantities, but needs some tricks to be adapted to coarse-grained systems (standard keywords are not understood by `VMD` on coarse-grained structures).

![Figure 3 \| RMSD of T4 lysozyme backbone with the three different approaches described previously: no bias, elastic network and GōMartini model (RMSD is usually considered "reasonable" if below 3 Å, but this depends of the system).](fig3.png)
