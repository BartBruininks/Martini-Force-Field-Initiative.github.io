## Martini 3 Tutorials
<hr>

The tutorials described here aim to help you familiarize yourself with some of the basic and more advanced aspects of using GROMACS to perform Martini 3.0 simulations. This page is currently under expansion. More tutorials are available for Martini 2: [http://cgmartini.nl/index.php/tutorials-general-introduction-gmx5](http://cgmartini.nl/index.php/tutorials-general-introduction-gmx5). 

*The Martini 3.0 tutorials were written by Riccardo Alessandri, Juan Carlos RamiÃÅrez Palacios, Paulo C. T. Souza, and Sebastian Thallmair.*

**Note**: This tutorial, now based on the Martini 3 open-beta version ([v.3.0.b.3.2](http://cgmartini.nl/index.php/martini3beta)), will be updated as soon as the final parameters of Martini 3 are available (the paper is under review right now).
