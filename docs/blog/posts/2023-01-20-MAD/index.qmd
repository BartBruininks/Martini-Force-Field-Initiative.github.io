The paper presenting MAD - the Martini Database Server - is now online in JCIM: [https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jcim.2c01375](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jcim.2c01375)

MAD is designed for the sharing of structures and topologies of molecules parametrized with Martini. MAD also provides a GUI to convert atomistic structures into CG structures and prepare complex systems. Please check it out: [https://mad.ibcp.fr](https://mad.ibcp.fr)
