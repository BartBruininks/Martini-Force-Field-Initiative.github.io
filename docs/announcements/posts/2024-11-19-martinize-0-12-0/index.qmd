As of Martinize2 version 0.12.0, the defaults of the `-scfix` and `-cys` flags have been changed.

`-scfix` is now assumed by default, so it is no longer necessary to specify it. If you do, a warning will be raised.
If you purposefully intend to generate protein models without side chain fixes, the `-noscfix` flag can be used.

Additionally, the default argument of `-cys` is changed to `auto` to search for disulfide bridges in your topology
by default, so no longer needs to be explicitly specified unless you want to turn off the behaviour (`-cys none`) or
specify the search distance for disulfide bridges manually (e.g. `-cys 5` will enforce disulfide bridges between
cysteines within 5 nm of each other).
