Are you impressed by the interesting science done by using the Martini coarse-grained model, and do you want to hear from the developers about the philosophy, back-ground, current, and future developments of Martini? Moreover, do you want to practice coarse-graining skills under the guidance of Martini experts? The Martini workshop is the place for you!

**Where:** Where: University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands. More precisely in the Feringa Building on the Zernike Campus.

**When:** August 10-15, 2025. The workshop starts Sunday, August 10, 20:00 hours and finishes Friday, August 15, 13:00 hours.

**What:** Lectures/presentations discussing back-ground, philosophy, and theory of coarse-graining in general and the Martini coarse-grained model in particular. Attention is given also to tools for setting up these types of simulations and building complex systems. Hands-on sessions experiencing aspects of the model yourself, getting practical experience with running, setting-up, and developing new or refined Martini models. Experienced developers and users are available for guidance and discussion. The workshop will also include a poster session in which participants can share their work and/or plans for future work as a catalyst for discussions.

**Who:** Anyone interested. However, our main aim is at PhD students and post-docs starting in the field of coarse-graining, either as main interest or as a technique to support experimental work. We assume you to have a working knowledge of the Linux operating system and some experience in running MD simulations. The idea is to let everyone work and progress at their own level, from beginner to more experienced modeler. However, you will get more out of the workshop if you invest time in some modeling tools before the workshop. All hands-on exercises use recent version(s) of GROMACS. If you do not have experience with GROMACS, get some practice before the workshop. That will liberate time to spend on learning coarse-graining instead of on learning GROMACS.

**NOTE!!:** For the hands-on sessions, you will need to bring your own laptop, from which you will be able to log in to a web-based custom- made environment.

**Costs:** 400 Euro registration fee. For this money, you get a welcome drink and snacks, coffee/tea during breaks (but no lunches), drinks and snacks during the poster session, a workshop dinner, and expert input during lectures and hands-on sessions. Travel and accommodation are your own responsibility. We have no funds available for financial support, but we have arranged special offers from two hotels if you book your hotel early. The hotel room will cost you at least â‚¬ 70 per night (room shared by 2 persons, incl. tourist tax). Of course, there are other possibilities for staying in or around Groningen. More details will provided if you are accepted as a participant, see next item.

**Application Procedure:** By COMPLETING the online application form following this link:

[https://www.formdesk.com/rug/Martiniworkshop2025](https://www.formdesk.com/rug/Martiniworkshop2025)

The application form contains a number of required fields to be filled out. Among these is a motivation and statement of your research interests. We want this information to help us identify possible focus areas for the workshop. Other fields are optional, but we would appreciate the information on your experience thus far to help us prepare (better) hands-on sessions and the other information to help us in practical organizational matters.

The number of participants is limited to 40, and in principle, you will be invited on a first-come-first-serve basis. So do not wait too long to apply! However, we might limit the number of participants from the same lab. After we receive and approve your application, we will send an invitation letter including payment details, and you are guaranteed a place if you pay the registration fee before the advertised deadline.

**APPLICATION CLOSES** when workshop is full. ONLY A FEW SPACES REMAIN
