Integrating and optimising existing tools to visualise Martini systems in VMD, MartiniGlass is a new small Python package
to rapidly generate visualisable topologies for your systems. The package may be particularly useful for inspecting
your protein topology, or generating nice images with coarse grained beads linked - no more VDW drawing method necessary!
MartiniGlass has full documentation and tutorials on its [readthedocs site](https://martiniglass.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

For details, see [Brasnett and Marrink, JCIM (2025)](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jcim.4c02277).
