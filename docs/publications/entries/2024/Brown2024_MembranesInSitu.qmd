## Abstract

Molecular dynamics simulations of cellular membranes have come a long wayâ€”from simple model lipid bilayers to multicomponent systems capturing the crowded and complex nature of real cell membranes. In this opinionated minireview, we discuss the current challenge to simulate the dynamics of membranes in their native environment, in situ, with the prospect of reaching the level of whole cells and cell organelles using an integrative modeling framework.
