## Abstract

The effect of viscosity on the encounter rate of two interacting membranes was investigated by combining a non-equilibrium Fokker-Planck model together with extensive Molecular Dynamics (MD) calculations. The encounter probability and stabilization of transient contact points represent the preliminary steps toward short-range adhesion and fusion of lipid leaflets. To strengthen our analytical model, we used a Coarse Grained MD method to follow the behavior of two charged palmitoyl oleoyl phosphatidylglycerol membranes embedded in a electrolyte-containing box at different viscosity regimes. Solvent friction was modulated by varying the concentration of a neutral, water-soluble polymer, polyethylene glycol, while contact points were stabilized by divalent ions that form bridges among juxtaposed membranes. While a na√Øve picture foresees a monotonous decrease of the membranes encounter rate with solvent viscosity, both the analytical model and MD simulations show a complex behavior. Under particular conditions, the encounter rate could exhibit a maximum at a critical viscosity value or for a critical concentration of bridging ions. These results seem to be confirmed by experimental observations taken from the literature.
