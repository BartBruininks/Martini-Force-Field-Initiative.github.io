## Abstract

Biological membranes exhibit diversity in their shapes and complexity in chemical compositions that are linked to many cellular functions. These two central features of biomembranes have been the subject of numerous simulation studies, using a diverse range of computational techniques. Currently, the field is able to capture this complexity at increasing levels of realism and connect the microscopic view on proteinâ€“lipid interactions to cellular morphologies at the level of entire organelles. Here we highlight recent advances in this topic, identify current bottlenecks, and sketch possible ways ahead.
